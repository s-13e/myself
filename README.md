## Failed but Learned Projects
[Starlit]
An editor desktop app and my first project. It aimed to help users edit large amounts of text, add character profiles, analyze novel genres, and detect words that didn't match the genre.

While working on this project, I encountered several challenges and eventually decided to discontinue it. Here's what I learned:

- Market competition: I realized there are already powerful competitors in the text editor field, and I wasn't confident I could stand out.
- Time investment: Completing this project would have required at least two years of full-time work, which was a significant commitment as a solo developer.
- Maintenance issues: Even if I finished the project, maintaining it alone—debugging and fixing errors—seemed overwhelming.
- Skill development: I often struggled to find proper information and bug solutions, so I relied on Chatbots for code assistance. This led to gaps in my C# knowledge, but on the bright side, I became quite skilled in prompt engineering.
  
- Ultimately, this project taught me valuable lessons about project scope, market analysis, and leveraging modern tools effectively. Even though it wasn't completed, the experience helped me grow as a developer.
